## Chapter 11. Selection
### I. Response and its prediction

There are two ways in which the action of the breeder can change the genetic properties of the population:
1.  Choice of individuals to be used as parents
2.  Control of the way in which the parents are mated

Application of quantitative genetics can help in selection:
- by showing how to choose individuals with best breeding values
- by predicting the outcome so that different breeding schemes can be compared.

Simple form of selection: individuals own (Per Se) phenotypic performance.

In this, the changes in gene frequency themselves, however, are almost completely hidden from us. The effects of selection that can be observed are therefore restricted mainly to changes of the population mean. 

#### Response to selection
Response to selection (R) = difference of mean phenotypic value between the offspring of the selected parents and the whole of the parental generation before selection

Selection differential (S) = average superiority of the selected parents [mean phenotypic value of individuals selected as parents expressed as a deviation from the population mean]

R = h2S ( where h2 is also the slope (b) of the regression line between mid-parent values and offspring values)

Assumptions that can alter the selection expectations:
- assortative mating ( it has very little effect on mid-parent regression)
- when dominance is in action, can lead to non-linearity ( happens usually with one or few loci with dominance effect)

##### prediction of response

Regression of offspring on parent cannot be measured until offspring generation has been reared, but the R=h2S equation provides a means of prediction from knowledge of heritability from previous generation.

The prediction of response is only valid, in principle, for one generation of selection. Since response depends on heritability of character in the generation from which parents are selected so responses cannot be predicted without knowledge of heritability in each generation.

1. If there is a response, gene frequency must change (small unless only a few loci are involved)
2. selection of parent reduces variance and the heritability

However, the expected changes in heritability are not large and response is usually maintained with little changes over several generations (five, ten, or more).

##### selection differential and intensity of selection
Selection differential can be predicted in advance if two conditions are met:
1. phenotypic values are normally distributed.
2. selection is by truncation

Truncation selection means that individuals are chosen strictly in order of merit as judged by their phenotypic values, no individual being selected that is less good than any of those rejected.

Selection intensity (i) is the selection differential divided by standard deviation (measure of variability), i = S/Vp. Selection intensity depends on the proportion of the population included in the selected group and provided the distribution of phenotypic values is normal it can be determined from tables of the properties of the normal distribution.
