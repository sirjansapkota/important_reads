[BrAPI](https://brapi.org) : 
The Breeding API (BrAPI) Project is an effort to create a RESTful specification to enable interoperability among plant breeding databases.
WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF USING BRAPI?
The Breeding API specifies a standard interface for plant phenotype/genotype databases to serve their data to crop breeding applications. It is a shared, open API, to be used by all data providers and data consumers who wish to participate.

Main features:
 Genotype visualization using [Flapjack](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack/) [Citation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956241)

 [TASSEL] (https://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel) : Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution and Linkage
 TASSEL is a software package used to evaluate traits associations, evolutionary patterns, and linkage disequilibrium. Strengths of this software include:
 
1. The opportunity for a number of new and powerful statistical approaches to association mapping such as a General Linear Model (GLM) and Mixed Linear Model (MLM). MLM is an implementation of the technique which our recently published Nature Genetics paper - Unified Mixed-Model Method for Association Mapping - which reduces Type I error in association mapping with complex pedigrees, families, founding effects and population structure.

2. An ability to handle a wide range of indels (insertion & deletions). Most software ignore this type of polymorphism; however, in some species (like maize), this is the most common type of polymorphism.
