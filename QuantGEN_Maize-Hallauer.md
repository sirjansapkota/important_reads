### Introduction
- The Northern Flints and Southern Dents were distinct complexes, but the expansion in maize cultivation southward (for the Northern Flints) and northward
(for the Southern Dents) resulted in a reciprocal introgression of the two complexes (Hudson, 2004).
- Two US developments in the early part of the 20th century had a profound effect on modern maize breeding: (1) development of the maize show card for exhibiting
maize ears in national maize shows had an effect on selection procedures of farmers, producers, and breeders for selecting ear types that conformed to show card standards and (2) public research reported independently by Shull (1908, 1909)and East (1908) outlined the basis of the breeding methods for developing and producing modern maize hybrids. The development of the maize show card had only a temporary effect on maize breeding, whereas public hybrid research formed the foundation of modern maize breeding and its successful profitable business.
- Although fields of maize were open pollinated, bottlenecks for genetic variability often would have resulted from the small number of ears representing the winning samples of maize shows
- Single-gene trait integration for one-, three-, and currently eight event hybrids (e.g., system proposed by Monsanto and Dow Agrosciences) is an additional challenging phase. It requires a detailed system of conversions, testing, integration with inbred line development, and data management.
- Because of the poor vigor and seed production of the inbred lines, Shull and East were somewhat pessimistic that the procedure would have practical usefulness. It was not until Jones (1918) suggested that two single crosses be used as parents in the production of hybrids that it seemed hybrid maize would become a reality.
- The change from open-pollinated varieties to double-cross hybrids was a significant improvement in developing maize hybrids with improved standability and grain yield performance. As a consequence, breeding efforts toward population improvement and genetic diversity were reduced.
- Largest maize research organization in the private sector at the time, ‘Funk Farms,’ produced the first maize double-cross hybrid (US13).
- First Pioneer hybrid for sale was ‘Copper Cross’ in 1924, using East's Leaming lines as female.
- __It soon became evident that it was simpler to develop inbred lines than it was to determine their worth in hybrids especially for quantitative traits.__
- Preliminary screening techniques by Davis (1927) and Jenkins and Brunson (1932) showed that crossing lines with a common tester (procedure often referred to either topcross or testcross by maize breeders) was effective for discarding lines that did not have satisfactory performance in hybrids.
- Even if only 20 lines were available for testing in hybrids, 190 different single crosses and 14,535 different double crosses were possible.
- If yield potential of lines in crosses could be determined before homozygosity, many lines could be discarded based on their combining ability to reduce the number continued by selfing. In addition, correlations between early- and late-generation testcrosses did show that the differences between performance of early- and late- generation testcrosses were primarily due to non-genetic factors [(Bernardo, 1991)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00231272).
- Improvement in management (use of herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers) and in inbred lines (improved by selection, in many instances, recycled from earlier developed lines) permitted the production of single-cross hybrids that were economically feasible for producers and farmers.
- Selection pressure, therefore, would be 100% greater among inbred lines for use in single-cross hybrids. Although elite inbred lines that were extensively tested were used for producing hybrids, trade-offs usually were necessary in the selection of lines to compensate for their known weaknesses; this would be easier for two than for four elite inbred lines. Cockerham (1961) also showed theoretically that expected genetic variability and expected genetic gain among single-cross hybrids within a population would be at least double that among double-cross hybrids.
- These pre-breeding efforts were initiated in the public sector by individuals who appreciate the possible contributions of exotic germplasm in order to increase the genetic diversity of commercial hybrids. Pre-breeding is the long-term conservation and utilization of genetic resources linked to an efficient cultivar development process (Carena et al., 2009b).
