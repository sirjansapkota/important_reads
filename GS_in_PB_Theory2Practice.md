# Genomic selection in plant breeding: from theory to practice  [Jannink et. al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20156985)

The weaknesses of traditional MAS come from the way MAS splits the task into two components, first identifying QTL and then estimating their effects.

QTL identification methods can make MAS poorly suited to crop improvement: 

__(i)__ biparental populations may be used that are not representative and in any event do not have the same level of allelic diversity and phase as the breeding program as a whole
__(ii)__ the necessity of generating such populations is costly such that the populations may be small and therefore underpowered; 
__(iii)__ validation of discoveries is then warranted, requiring additionaleffort;
__(iv)__ the separation of QTL identification from estimation means that estimated effects will be biased, and small-effect QTL will be missed entirely as a result of using stringent significance thresholds.
